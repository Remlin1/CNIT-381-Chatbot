### Prerequisites:

For our testing purpose we have tested on a linux based virtual machine, however you can use whatever OS you see fit, but keep in mind the steps for initial setup may vary.

A webex developer account will need to be created and keep note of the API token that you are given from webex.

Using the command "ngrok http 5000" will create a local server webook that you can use to interact with webex, keep track of your webhook URL.
